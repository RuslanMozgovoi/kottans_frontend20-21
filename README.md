## Git Basics

As it turned out, Git is a very useful and necessary thing for both personal and group development of sites / applications.<br/>
Particularly useful is the versioning of the project code: you can always see what changes (including which lines of code) were added to the project, and if the commit name is specified correctly, it becomes clear what functionality these changes have added / fixed.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

- New: Linux commands, Clarifiaction of HTTP.
- Surprised: How caching proxies work.

## HTML & CSS practice: Hooli-style Popup

During this task I've had a good practice with knowledge from previous tasks and definitly learned a lot of new stuff: checkbox tricks, basics of BEM, usage of sibling and child selectors, usage of before and after pseudo elements.<br/>
And what is the most important I've had the first experience when someone reviews my code and then I make edits in the code trying to get it better:)<br/><br/>
I want to thank the mentors for the time they spent on reviewing my code and code of other students!

## JS Basics

I knew JS on basic level and passed these courses before, but it was great to pass them once again for repeating and deeper understanding of things you already know.<br/>
Also Algorithm tasks are great to improve your knowledge and understanding even if some of them you've done before then you try to find better decision for this task. And solutions from 'Get a Hint' (I looked at it after finishing every algorithm task) show that sometimes the same task can be done much more clever, shorter and prettier:)

## A Tiny JS World

It was a good practice before we start to go deep in OOP. And even though this task was not so hard at a first glance, still there were a lot to improve in my code.
