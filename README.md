## Git Basics

As it turned out, Git is a very useful and necessary thing for both personal and group development of sites / applications.
Particularly useful is the versioning of the project code: you can always see what changes (including which lines of code) were added to the project, and if the commit name is specified correctly, it becomes clear what functionality these changes have added / fixed.
